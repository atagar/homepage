This repository contains the code behind my small [personal website](https://www.atagar.com/).

This shouldn't be of much interest, but if you find the code useful feel free to borrow. Styling is a simplified rewrite of the [W3C dark portfolio template](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_dark_portfolio.htm).
